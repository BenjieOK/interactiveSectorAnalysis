<!-- Chosen Palette: Hubtel Colors (Orange, Dark Blue, Green, Yellow) -->
<!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as an interactive dashboard for sector analysis. The information architecture is task-oriented, allowing a user to select a specific merchant sector and explore its complete profile in one view. The layout uses a persistent left-hand navigation for switching contexts, which is more intuitive than scrolling. The main content area dynamically updates to show a "Sector at a Glance" (KPIs), detailed charts for "Collections & Withdrawals," a "Service Adoption" analysis, and "Key Insights." This structure was chosen because the source report is a collection of discrete profiles. A dashboard that allows quick switching between these profiles is the most effective way to facilitate comparison and understanding, which is superior to a long, linear scroll. -->
<!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
- Sector Selection: Goal: Navigate. Method: Clickable list (HTML/JS). Justification: A clear, always-visible navigation for switching between the core subjects of the report.
- KPIs: Goal: Inform. Method: "Big Number" stat cards (HTML/CSS). Justification: Provides a quick, scannable summary for the selected sector.
- Monthly Trends: Goal: Show Change. Method: Bar Chart (Chart.js). Justification: Best for comparing discrete monthly totals for both collections and withdrawals on the same timeline.
- Withdrawal Method: Goal: Compare Composition. Method: Doughnut Chart (Chart.js). Justification: Clearly shows the value split between Bank and MoMo withdrawals.
- Service Adoption: Goal: Compare. Method: Bar Chart (Chart.js). Justification: A simple bar chart is effective for comparing the adoption rates of distinct services side-by-side, offering a direct visual comparison.
- Textual Insights: Goal: Inform. Method: Dynamically updated text blocks (HTML/JS). Justification: Presents the qualitative findings from the report directly alongside the relevant data visualizations.
